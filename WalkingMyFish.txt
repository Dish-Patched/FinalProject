It started as a joke, a goldfish in a rolling tank on wheels, leashed with a string of pearls. Down the sidewalk they went, drawing stares and laughter, the fish bobbing happily, unaware of the absurdity. They stopped at crosswalks, visited the park, and watched the ducks with mutual confusion. People said it couldnâ€™t be done, but that fish had the best walk of its life, even if it was technically a roll.
