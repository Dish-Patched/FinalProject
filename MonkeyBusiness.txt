It started with a stolen banana and ended with a jungle-wide dance party. The monkeys were up to no good, swiping sunglasses from tourists, replacing jungle signs with nonsense, and somehow starting a conga line of toucans. They held secret meetings in the treetops, traded coconuts for shiny trinkets, and giggled every time a zookeeper slipped on a vine. Monkey business, indeed, equal parts mischief and genius.
