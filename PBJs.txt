There’s a simple magic in the squish of soft bread, the salty smoothness of peanut butter, and the sweet zing of jelly dancing in between. It’s comfort between two slices, a childhood memory that never grows old, and a balance of protein, sugar, and nostalgia. Peanut butter hugs the jelly like an old friend, and every bite feels like a smile, sticky, sweet, and just right.
