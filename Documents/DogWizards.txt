In a realm where magic crackles through the air like static, dog wizards stand as noble guardians of ancient secrets and enchanted forests. Cloaked in robes stitched with stardust and bearing staffs carved from moonwood, these mystical canines command the arcane with both wisdom and whimsy. Their barks echo spells of protection, healing, and transformation, while their keen noses sniff out hidden truths and dark curses. Dog wizards are deeply loyal to their companions—both human and beast—and often serve as guides for lost travelers or mentors to young spellcasters. Beneath their floppy ears and wagging tails lies a deep reservoir of power, bound by an unshakable code of honor and the occasional belly rubs.
