In the shadowed corners of mushroom groves where the soil was always damp and the moonlight strange, gnome necromancers whispered ancient chants. They werenâ€™t evil, just eccentric, raising skeletal squirrels to tidy gardens and summoning ghostly frogs to serenade the night. Their tiny staffs glowed with eerie runes and their robes smelled of damp moss and mystery. They held tea parties with the undead, played chess with haunted hedgehogs, and never missed a harvest. Death for them was just another phase of life and another chance to party.
