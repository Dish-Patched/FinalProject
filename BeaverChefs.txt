With nimble paws and a passion for structure, beavers would run five-star restaurants by the riverbank. They’d craft wood-fired ovens from scratch, prepare meals on handcrafted cutting boards, and slice ingredients with teeth sharper than any knife. Their menus would feature fresh fish, bark-based broths, and dam-fresh spring water. Every dish served with meticulous care, presented on a leaf with a sprig of mint. Michelin stars? They’d build their own.
