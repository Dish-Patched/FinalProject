Behind every purr is a plot. They knock your water off the table then stare into your soul like it was your fault. They demand food with royal flair only to walk away once it’s served. They climb curtains for fun, hide under beds for drama, and stare into empty corners like they see something you can’t. They are adorable overlords, furry agents of chaos, and we love them anyway. Probably their plan all along.
