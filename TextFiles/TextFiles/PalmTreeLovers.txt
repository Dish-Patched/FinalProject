They stood rooted on opposite ends of a sandy shore, swaying gently in the breeze, sending messages through rustling fronds. For years, they leaned toward each other, reaching ever so slightly closer with each passing storm. Birds nested in their branches, waves whispered their names, and one moonlit night, a hurricane bent their trunks until they finally touched. Together forever they stood, tangled at the top, a love grown slowly but unbreakably strong.
