Under the pale moonlight, the ancient owl named Thistle perched atop the tallest pine. With a flick of his tail, he summoned glowing runes that danced in the night air. All was silent, except the hum of magic in the breeze. He guarded a powerful tome, its pages filled with spells forgotten by time. "A secret only the wind knew," he whispered, as the stars blinked in agreement. Time stood still as Thistle cast one final spell to keep the forest safe forever.
