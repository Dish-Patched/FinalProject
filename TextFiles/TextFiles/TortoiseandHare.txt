The hare was fast, arrogant even. He zoomed ahead, confident in victory, and decided to nap mid-race. The tortoise, slow but steady, kept going, never stopping, one quiet step at a time. While the hare snored in the shade, the tortoise crossed the finish line. Lesson learned, speed is cool but consistency wins.
