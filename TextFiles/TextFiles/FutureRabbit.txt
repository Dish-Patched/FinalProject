In the hidden glen, a rabbit named Luma had visions under the pale moonlight. With a flick of his tail, strange symbols appeared in the dirt. All was silent when he entered a trance, eyes glowing with foresight. "A secret only the wind knew," he mumbled as others listened in awe. Time stood still each time he spoke, for fate itself paused to hear him.
